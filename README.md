## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **IS 6813 ‚Äì Analytics Capstone** at the University of Utah, in partnership with **Swire Coca-Cola**. The goal was to **optimize customer segmentation for beverage delivery**, improving operational efficiency and identifying high-growth customers using advanced analytics.

Swire currently delivers via two service models:
- **Red Truck**: In-house delivery for high-volume accounts
- **White Truck**: 3rd-party delivery for smaller, less profitable accounts

We proposed a smarter, data-driven delivery assignment strategy by:
- Predicting customer value using characteristics **not reliant on volume**
- Improving assignment to Red or White Truck to **reduce cost and recapture future growth**

## Business Value

‚úîÔ∏è **Cost Optimization**: Reassignment of low-potential accounts from Red to White Truck frees up high-cost labor and delivery routes  
‚úîÔ∏è **Growth Enablement**: Retains high-potential customers under Red Truck to increase sales velocity  
‚úîÔ∏è **Data-Driven Strategy**: Uses machine learning to prevent reliance on rigid volume thresholds  
‚úîÔ∏è **Future-Proof**: Incorporates channel type and market conditions into decisioning

## Technical Highlights

### Data Wrangling
- Cleaned and merged 4 disparate datasets (customer profiles, addresses, transactions, delivery costs)
- Converted delivery ranges, resolved missing zip codes, and parsed geographic metadata
- Removed duplicate transactions and handled negative deliveries (returns)

### Segmentation Strategy
- Applied **PAM Clustering with Gower‚Äôs Distance** to assign customers to behavior-based clusters
- Used **KNN and Centroid Matching** to assign missing cluster labels

### Predictive Modeling
- Built **Random Forest classifiers** to predict high-value customers at various thresholds (`400+`, `500+`, `600+` cases/gallons)
- Applied **SMOTE oversampling** to balance the target variable
- Created a dedicated model for **Local Market Partners (LMPs)**

### Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~90%
- Sensitivity: 72‚Äì78% for high-value class
- Top Predictors: Customer tenure, cluster, sub trade channel, order type, neighbor transaction behavior

## Interview Talking Points

- How I used **unsupervised clustering to uncover latent customer segments**
- Why I focused on **features unrelated to volume** for identifying growth opportunities
- The logic and impact of **reassigning delivery models** using predictive insights
- How I applied **SMOTE** to resolve class imbalance in real-world business datasets
- My process for ensuring **reproducibility and data integrity** throughout the project

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Open `Tyler_Cleaning_Script.Rmd` to run the full cleaning process  
3. Use the cleaned `Swire_Master_Data` to explore modeling via `Modeling_Swire_Capstone_Tyler.Rmd`  
4. Optional: export visuals or extend with Shiny/Power BI dashboards

## Tools Used

- **R (tidyverse, janitor, lubridate, cluster, smotefamily)**
- **R Markdown** for reproducible analysis
- **GitHub** for version control and portfolio building
